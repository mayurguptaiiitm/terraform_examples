This repo is created to learn terraform via different examples. 

Ideally i will try to maintain the repo with the examples being done. 

Only aspect is that the code will be on lab environments where admin access outside resource group will not be available

project1 is for webserver creation with load balancer and all other details though its huge but can be split further. 

project2 is for terraform state file storage on the cloud.
